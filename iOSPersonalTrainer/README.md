#  Personal Trainer Client Application

So, I cleared all of the errors. It says there are not any issues and that build succeeded.... However, when I launch the app simulator, it stays on the apple home screen, and Xcode closes.

If you can give me any insight as to why it has a fatal crash, I will gladly resubmit with screenshots!!!
